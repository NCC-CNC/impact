### Overview ###
The tool is developed to extract national conservation themes to new project management plans (PMP) and report 
property contributions to reaching regional goals. Extracting national conservation themes to PMPs allows
planners to assess and compare the impact of new properties.

Themes include: amphibians, biodiversity, birds, carbon (current), carbon (potential), climate refugia, climate velocity, endemics, forest, freshwater, grassland, lakes, mammals, recreation, reptiles, river shoreline, species at risk (ECCC), species at risk (NSC) and wetland.

### Workflow ###
 1. PMPs are uploaded by the user and explored on the map
 2. National conservation themes are extracted to each property
 3. Attributes from an individual property can be viewed in table and plot form
 4. Attributes from all properties within a PMP can be compared to one another in table and plot form
 5. PMPs with extracted themes are exported to .csv and .shp format

**Note** this tool is a work in progress. Please contact <daniel.wismer@natureconservancy.com>
