<h2 align="center">Project Evaluation</h2>

This tool is designed to evaluate new `project management plans (PMP)` and their impact
to securing `national conservation features`.

**1)** Explore the achievements layer and view what is currently protected <br>
**2)** Upload a new PMP and extract conservation features to parcels <br> 
**3)** Compare conservation features between boundaries  <br>
**4)** Download extractions in polygon and table format

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Framed under the lens of resilient landscapes, the aim is to build a protected reserve network that is: 

**C**onnected - so that species habitats and processes can survive <br>
**A**dequte - so that there is enough high quality habitat for species to persist <br>
**R**epresentative - so that targeted habitats and important species exist <br>
**E**ffective - so that protected areas are cost-effective with objectives met <br>

**Figure 1:** *Prioritization results. Blue areas correspond to ~81.5M hectares and represents lands that would most optimally ensure a resilient landscape.*

<h3>Conservation Features</h3>

Conservation features used for **goal setting** include: species at risk (SAR), endemic and
general biodiversity. 

Conservation features used for **impact measurements** include: key biodiversity areas (KBA),
under-represented areas, climate change resilience, connectivity, direct human pressures, habitat,
carbon, freshwater and access.

*Conservation features have been curated to reflect the national 1km grid standard.*
